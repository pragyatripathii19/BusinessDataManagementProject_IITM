VP Fire System Private Limited is a Delhi-based B2B provider of fire and security solutions, established in 2018. Despite steady growth, the business faced three key challenges: forecasting seasonal demand, better understanding its customer base for targeted marketing, and increasing market visibility in high-potential sectors like hotels and hospitals.

To address these issues, sales and purchase data from October to December 2024 were collected, cleaned, and structured. Descriptive analysis highlighted highly skewed sales distributions, extreme outliers, and a clear Pareto pattern in customer purchases. Weekly seasonality in demand was also identified.

Advanced analytics were applied, including RFM analysis, K-Means clustering, and ARIMA/SARIMA forecasting. The analysis segmented clients into Mid-Value (50%), High-Value VIPs (7 customers), and Low-Value groups. Clustering also revealed a loyal core and a churn-risk segment. SARIMA(1,1,2)(1,0,1)[7] emerged as the optimal model, accurately capturing weekly demand cycles.

Based on these insights, recommendations included targeted marketing campaigns, win-back strategies, dedicated relationship managers for VIP clients, and integration of cluster labels into CRM systems. Forecasting was used to plan inventory and staffing ahead of seasonal peaks. As a result, VP Fire System improved customer engagement, reduced stock-outs, and enhanced market visibility through strategic promotions, successfully shifting toward proactive, data-driven decision-making.
